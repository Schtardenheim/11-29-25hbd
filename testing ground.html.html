          <p class="boxText">I just want to let you know that you are a great person to be around, someone that 
            inspires me to be better, someone that I consider as my equal. It may seem as a stretch
            but I've actually liked you for a while HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA since sept pa actually
            and ever since then I've planned this coding-type confession
            for you. It's so random but at the same time, I feel like it isn't kasi out of nowhere
            with just one glance, I suddenly realized how smart and beautiful you are.
            You're someone that I admire not just for your looks but for your personality and intellect as well,
            and I know na even with everything going on, you still manage to stay not just kind and thoughtful
            but also driven and focused on your goals.  I really respect that about you. The fact that you seem as if
            you're not even pushing yourself too hard yet you still manage to excel in everything you do is honestly
            something that I find really impressive and that's another reason why I like you.

            Everytime I look back to take a glance at you and we end up making eye contact, every moment
            where you talk, every test and quiz where we're both competing for the highest is something, the smile
            that you carry every day, and the way your presence makes the room brighter is something
            that consistenty made me nervous for a bit. I guess this is my way of asking if I could court you:>
             I hope that you take this small gift
            as a token of my appreciation for you being in my life,
             and I hope we can make more memories together in the future. Once again, happy birthday Kat!
          </p>
